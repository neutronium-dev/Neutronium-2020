    <h1>Neutronium 2020</h1>
    <p>We, Chlorine, are proud to announce our very first event "Neutronium 2020 | Digital Science and IT Carnival".
        Failure is a part of learning. We want to encourage the students to fall, to pick themselves up, and to learn
        from their failures. Science came to its current state through repeated trial and error by the Scientists. Yet
        nowadays, innovative projects that fail get no recognition at Science fairs while copied projects from the
        internet that simply work win. A Science/IT fair should prioritize learning and innovation. That's why in
        "Neutronium 2020 | Digital Science and IT Carnival" Chlorine is doing things in a new way. We are ditching the
        1st-2nd-3rd system and changing the whole judgement. Join us now and help us establish this change.</p>
